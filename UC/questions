1 q : product of the array except itself for every element
2 q : find a pair whose sum is equal to a target value.
3 q : queue implementation using linked list and array both. 

Log2 N vs Log3 N which is smaller. If log3 N is smaller, why canâ€™t we use log3 N
What is the complexity of concatenating a string object  
Find longest substring without repeating characters  

Print all anagrams together in array of strings
Expected time complexity should be O(MN).
Where M is length of an array and N is length of each word.
Ex- { cat,dog, act,god,tac}
O/p- [cat, act, tac] [dog,god]
